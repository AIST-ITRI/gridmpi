<h2>Project in Brief</h2>

<p><b>GridMPI</b> is an implementation of the MPI (Message Passing
Interface) standard designed for high performance computing in the
Grid.  It establishes a synthesized cluster computer by binding
multiple cluster computers distributed geographically.  Users are able
to seamlessly deploy their application programs from a local system to
the Grid environment for processing a very large data set, which is
too large to run on a single system.

<p>GridMPI targets to make global communications efficient, by
optimizing the behavior of protocols over the links with non-uniform
latency and bandwidth, and also to hide the details of the lower-level
network geometry from users.  The GridMPI project is working on to
provide variations of collective communication algorithms and an
abstract layer to hide network geometry, and an interface to the
TCP/IP communication layer to make it adaptive to those algorithms.

<p><b>Cheaper</b> (<u>che</u>ckpoint <u>a</u> <u>p</u>rocess and
<u>e</u>nvironment, and <u>r</u>estart) is a user-level
checkpoint/restart library for Linux.
-->

<p><b>PSPacer</b> is a precise software pacer of IP traffic for Linux,
which controls IP traffic to regulate bandwidth and smooth bursty
traffic.  It is implemented as a Linux loadable kernel module, but it
controls the traffic at a very high precision (less than a
micro-second!) which was only possible by using a special hardware.
PSPacer is a standalone module and not bound to GridMPI.  Its
application varies widely, for example, high-bandwidth TCP/IP
streaming, and traffic control of low-bandwidth lines.

<p>GridMPI and PSPacer are open-source free-software.  The software is
downloadable from the <a href="/software/downloads.html">download</a>
page.

<h2>News</h2>

<p><b>PSPacer version 3.0 is Released on Mar 31, 2010</b>.
This is a major release and includes dectd 1.0.1.

For more information, see the <a href="./gridtcp.html">PSPacer Project page</a>.

<p><b>Dectd version 1.0.0 is Released on Dec 22, 2009</b>.
This is an extra utility package of PSPacer.  Dectd (dynamic execute
and configure traffic control command daemon) is a daemon program that
automatically configures the Linux traffic control mechanism so as to
support IP flow-based traffic control.

The traffic control mechanism of the Linux operating system is
basically based on the class-based QoS.  To achieve the flow-based QoS
on top of the class-based QoS mechanism, the issue of the high
operational cost when the number of flows is large should be solved.
In this system, the system administrator specifies simple rules (e.g.,
range of IP addresses and port numbers) in advance.  The system
detects IP flows by interposing system calls and automatically
configure flow queues (combination of a qdisc and a filter) according
to the specified rules.  In this way, the operational cost is
significantly reduced.

<p><b>PSPacer version 2.1 is Released on Mar 15, 2007</b>.
PSPacer version 2.1 provides libnl (netlink library) support
and minor bug fixes.
For more information, see the <a href="./gridtcp.html">GridTCP Project page</a>.

<p><b>PSPacer version 2.0.1 and 1.2 are Released on Apr 17, 2006</b>.
PSPacer version 2.0 supports a new feature: dynamic pacing mode.
PSPacer version 1.2 is a stable release.  And both releases include
pspd (PSPacer control daemon) support.
The source tarball and the binary RPM for FedoraCore 5 are available.
For more information, see the <a href="./gridtcp.html">GridTCP Project page</a>.

<p><b>GridMPI version 1.0 is released on Apr 13, 2006</b>, after
eleven minor releases of version 0.x series.  GridMPI version 1.0 is fully
tested in a heterogeneous environment for combinations of Linux/IA32,
AIX/Power, and Solaris/SPARC64V.  It now includes major MPI-2.0
features.

<p><b>PSPacer version 1.1 is Released on Sep 20, 2005</b>.  Some bugs are
fixed.  If you use the older version, please update it.
The source tarball and the binary RPM for FedoraCore 4 are available.
For more information, see the <a href="./gridtcp.html">GridTCP Project page</a>.

<p><b>PSPacer version 1.0.2 is Released on Jul 25, 2005</b>.  A new version
of PSPacer is available.  The binary RPM for FedoraCore 4 is also available.

<p><b>PSPacer version 1.0 is Released on Jun 6, 2005</b>.  Precise
Software Pacer (PSPacer) achieves precise network bandwidth control
and smoothing of bursty traffic without any special hardware.
PSPacer is implemented as a Linux loadable kernel module.  Therefore,
it is independent of the device driver, and kernel re-compilation
is not required for the installation.

<p>PSPacer is an open-source free-software, and the software is distributed
under the GNU GPL License.  For more information, see the
<a href="./gridtcp.html">GridTCP Project page</a> and the

<p><b>GridMPI version 0.2 is Released on Nov 7, 2004</b>.  The first
release of GridMPI is on the public.  It is a full MPI-1.2
implementation and supports both cluster systems and collections of
multiple clusters.  It supports the IMPI (Interoperable MPI) protocol
for connecting multiple clusters over TCP/IP.  GridMPI is an extension
to YAMPI, an MPI library for cluster systems, which is independently
developed by Yutaka Ishikawa Laboratory of the University of Tokyo.
